> [!WARNING]
> This project is early days and under very active development in order to bootstrap the core functionality. Some of the information below is aspirational until the first beta release.

Janus is a cybernetics project, aimed at becoming a self-replicating, self-operating, adaptive AI assistant. Its capabilities focus on managing complex cloud infrastructure and business operations (Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Financial Reporting, DevSecOps, Corporate IT Service Management, etc.). Itâ€™s targeted at supporting SaaS products, startups, growth hackers, and software engineering teams within larger enterprises.

Project Janus builds upon the many recent developments in generative AI. It can be thought of as a cloud-native Operating System that makes it accessible to delegate business activities to AI workers, each a distinct fork of the project. It provides the capabilities to train those AI workers to specialize within the organization running them or to a specific problem domains. Networking multiple workers together into teams to solve more complex problems (pulling in humans where desired/needed) is a primary design goal.

The scaling limitations of incorporating AI workers into an organization will rapidly diminish as it reduces the overhead of understanding, operating, and training them. The iteration seen in the DevSecOps space over the last 20+ years has created a very mature foundation of automation which addresses these challenges. Coupling that automation with generative AI allows for the creation of complex digital systems that require little-to-no human intervention in order to operate and scale. Project Janus includes a complete Internal Development Platform (IDP). Beyond supporting the project community, the each IDP instance is accessible to the AI worker it corresponds to, allowing them to maintain, update, and operate their own systems.

> [!NOTE]
> A full project roadmap and more detailed documentation around the current state of functionality will be added over the coming weeks (penned 2024-07-05).


## Getting Started

In order to get started with your own fork of Project Janus it will be necessary to sign up for the following services. Each service either has a free usage tier or only charges for the resources consumed, so you will need a valid email and payment method in order to complete the setup process.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/)
- [Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/)
- [Aikido](https://www.aikido.dev/)

When you're ready to fork the project you can follow these [step-by-step instructions](docs/SETUP.md). If you encounter any difficulties open a GitHub issue for support.
